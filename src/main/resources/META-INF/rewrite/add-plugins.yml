type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: org.openrewrite.maven.migrate.AddMavenJarPlugin
displayName: Add Maven plugin to suppress Illegal Reflective Access Warnings.
description: Adds a maven jar plugin that is configured to suppress illegal reflective access warnings. The default behavior of the Java runtime is to log a warning the first time an illegal access call is made, and not log subsequent calls. The warning, while valid, produces noise in an organizations logging infrastructure, and may be suppressed by adding this plugin.
